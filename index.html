    <h2>Renewable Energy</h2>
    <p id="details1" class="parallax-inner">
        Renewable energy is energy that is collected from renewable resources, which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, including carbon neutral sources like sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. The term often also encompasses biomass as well, whose carbon neutral status is under debate. Renewable energy often provides energy in four important areas: electricity generation, air and water heating/cooling, transportation, and rural (off-grid) energy services.<br><br>
        Let us know a few ways in which we should use renewable energy:-<br>
        1. Solar panels can be used to collect solar energy and turn it into electricity, and more and more they are used in homes.<br>
        2. Water can also be used to gather electricity by hydroelectric power plants, which harness the flow of runoff water in rivers, streams and lakes. <br>
        3. A windmill is typically attached to a generator that is powered by its rotation: When the wind blows, its force turns the windmill.Today, windmills can be used for a variety of situations, including when a small amount of power is needed. <br><br>
        We get a number of benefits from usage of renewable energy. Some of them include:-<br>
        1. Generating energy that produces no greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and reduces some types of air pollution<br>
        2. Diversifying energy supply and reducing dependence on imported fuels<br>
        3. Creating economic development and jobs in manufacturing, installation, and more<br>

        <h2>Non-Renewable Energy</h2>
        <p id="details2" class="parallax-inner">
            A non-renewable resource (also called a finite resource) is a natural resource that cannot be readily replaced by natural means at a quick enough pace to keep up with consumption. An example is carbon-based fossil fuel. The original organic matter, with the aid of heat and pressure, becomes a fuel such as oil or gas. Earth minerals and metal ores, fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, natural gas) and groundwater in certain aquifers are all considered non-renewable resources, though individual elements are always conserved (except in nuclear reactions). <br><br>
            The three R's – Reduce, Reuse and Recycle – represent the best strategy for conserving non-renewable energy:-<br><br>
            1. The first R: Reduce -<br>
            Nearly 200 countries signed onto a treaty in Paris in 2015 that addressed reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The strategy for doing this includes reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Partly in an effort to meet treaty goals, many countries incorporated renewable energy into their infrastructures in the form of wind and solar energy generators, electric vehicles, passive solar architecture and other innovations.On an individual level, homeowners can take advantage of renewable energy as it becomes increasingly more available. They can install solar generators on their houses and choose energy providers that use renewable methods of generation. In communities that still rely heavily on fossil fuels, individuals can reduce their need for heat and electricity by properly insulating and leak-proofing their homes, turning off lights whenever possible and using energy-efficient appliances.<br><br>
            2. The second R: Reuse -<br>
            It takes energy to manufacture items that people use every day, such as clothing, personal appliances and electronic gadgets. You can minimize the energy used by the manufacturing sector by reusing things around the house, and you'll save money in the process. Here are a few ways to do it:<br>
              a. Donate used clothing and buy used when possible.<br>
              b. Repair your electronic equipment, car and appliances instead of replacing them with new products.<br>   
              c. Donate used or unwanted building materials and tools to a charity, such as Habitat for Humanity, instead of taking them to the dump.<br><br>
            3. Th third R: Recycle -<br>
            Recycling is a means of processing unwanted items and materials into new products instead of discarding them. This reduces the need for raw materials and the energy needed to produce them. On a global scale, many large manufacturers make a point of using recycled materials. Individuals can get in the game in many ways, including:<br>
            a. Upcycling used home furnishings, which involves adapting them to serve different purposes or giving them fresh new appearances.<br> 
            b. Discarding recyclable materials properly so they can be used to make new products. Such materials include objects made of plastic, glass, ceramic, metal and paper. Many waste management companies provide bins for this purpose to each household.<br>
            c. Buying products made with recycled materials. <br>
            d. Composting leftover food and using the compost to grow more food. The more food you grow yourself, the less you have to buy. Food producers won't have to make as much, and they'll end up using less energy.
